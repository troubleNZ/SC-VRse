Easily perform the necessary steps to enable VR HeadTracking 

This includes:
Enabling VORPX functionality (Vorpx not included) with Star Citizen by:
- setting the Route Table for bypassing EAC verification
- purging previously cached EAC files from temporary cache

Configure the Screen Size for VR use, configure your FOV, Height x Width, whether Headtracking is toggled on, and what the Tracking Source is, all without loading the game, or even while in game open the XML file remotely with this tool.

I'll expose more options soon. i think a fullscreen toggle would be useful.

## Fixed:
- Import and Export now works

## current issues:

- profile.json (which is used for convenience remembering last location on script start) is appending data instead of updating.
